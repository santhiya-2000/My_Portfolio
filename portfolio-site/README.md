# Santhiya Venkatesh — Portfolio

A pastel pink & white themed portfolio built with React + Vite. Includes pages for Home, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, Activities, and Contact (with an email form).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Customize

- Replace `public/assets/profile-placeholder.png` with your headshot and keep the same name (or update the path in `src/data/profile.js` → `hero.photoUrl`).
- Update links in `src/data/profile.js` (LinkedIn URL, etc.).
- Replace the Formspree endpoint in `src/pages/Contact.jsx` with your form ID (https://formspree.io).

## Deploy

- Netlify: drag & drop the `dist/` folder after `npm run build`.
- Vercel: import the repo; it will detect Vite automatically.
